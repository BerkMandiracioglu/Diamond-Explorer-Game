# Diamond-Explorer-Game
This is a game that was implemented on a FPGA device called Basys3 using Systemverilog. The aim of the game is to collect all the diamonds on the board without colliding to bombs. You can move around the board in 8 directions. When you choose to go in a direction the explorer keeps its motion until it encounters a checkpoint, wall or a border. Checkpoints stop the motion of the explorer when it is on it. Walls stop the motion of explorer when the explorer is moving towards the direction of the wall and gets in front of it. This game was my CS-223 Digital Design and Computer Architecture project in Bilkent University. I have used sequential and combinational logic blocks to implement this game. Vivado tool was used in order to run my project on Basys3.
